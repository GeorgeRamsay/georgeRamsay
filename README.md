Hi, Iâ€™m George, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about leveraging my skills to collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, and contribute to the success of agile development teams.

### Currently, I am working as a Full Stack Developer at The University of Auckland ###

I am part of a team developing an innovative web application designed to enhance daily life for individuals with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We expand existing functionalities, implement new features based on client requirements, and continuously refine the solution to maximize its impact. Our tech stack includes React, TypeScript, and .NET C#, ensuring a robust and scalable system.
